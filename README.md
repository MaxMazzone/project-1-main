Develpment:
Initial planning and staging included wireframing the single page application and creating user stories to map features. Requirements and technical specification were provided by GA WDI team.

Initial development included creating basic HTML to hold the game board. With the rough gameboard in place, development moved to creating game logic to create working tic tac toe logic and to meet required specifications.

Once game logic was produced, development proceeded to API and authentication to allow user to sign in, update account info and to communicate with server to allow games to be saved and updated.

Once API and authentication were achieved, work progressed to streamlining UI and user interactions as well as including user facing messages.

After developing a UI which met technical requirements, development moved to troubleshooting, testing and repairing bugs.

Once a stable game was achieved, styling and user interface improvements were made.

Future development would include increased userfacing improvements as well as multiplayer capability.
